# dwm-repo
This is my dwm build.

It's not pretty but it's mine and works perfectly fine as I want it too. Colors inspiration from DistroTube.

Patches:
 - rotatestack (ctrl+shift+(J|K))
 - movestack (I'm pretty sure they do the same thing, it might be this one that I'm actually using. Either way, I somehow got both and am using only one)
 - autostart (in '.dwm/autostart.sh', I share mine in my dotfiles repo)
 - gridlayout (sometimes useful, alt+g)

I may have also added some simple bindings (surely nothing fancy) and I think I remapped few keys but these are also very minor changes (like terminator as default terminal emulator and such stuff).
