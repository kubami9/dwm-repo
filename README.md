# dwm-repo
This is my dwm build.

It's not pretty but it's mine and works perfectly fine as I want it too. Colors inspiration from DistroTube.
Alt is the modkey.

Patches (all diffs in patches folder):
 - rotatestack (alt+shift+(J|K))
 - movestack (I'm pretty sure they do the same thing, it might be this one that I'm actually using. Either way, I somehow got both and am using only one)
 - autostart (in '.dwm/autostart.sh', I share mine in my dotfiles repo)
 - gridlayout (alt+g)
 - fullfaps (default 7px, set to 0 with alt+=)
 - restartsig (restarts dwm with alt+shift+ctrl+q)

I may have also added some simple bindings (surely nothing fancy) and I think I remapped few keys but these are also very minor changes (like terminator as default terminal emulator and such stuff).
